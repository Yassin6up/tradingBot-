Please enhance our existing Python trading bot to create a smarter, more profitable AI trading system with advanced features. The core goal is to minimize losses while maximizing profits through intelligent strategy adaptation and robust risk management.

First, implement multiple sophisticated trading strategies beyond the current basic approach. Create at least 5 specialized strategies: Scalping for quick small gains, Swing Trading for medium-term positions, Trend Following for riding market momentum, Mean Reversion for range-bound markets, and Breakout Trading for volatility periods. Each strategy should have optimized parameters for different market conditions.

Develop an AI Strategy Selector that automatically chooses the best strategy based on real-time market analysis. This AI brain should monitor market volatility, trend strength, volume patterns, and macroeconomic indicators to dynamically switch between strategies. Implement machine learning to analyze historical performance data and continuously improve strategy selection.

Significantly enhance the risk management system. Add dynamic position sizing that adjusts based on market volatility using ATR (Average True Range), implement correlation analysis to avoid overexposure to similar assets, create circuit breakers that automatically reduce trading during high volatility, and add a maximum daily loss limit that pauses trading if exceeded.

Improve the technical analysis capabilities by adding more advanced indicators: Ichimoku Cloud for comprehensive trend analysis, Fibonacci retracement levels, Volume Profile for key support/resistance, and Market Profile for time-based analysis. Implement multi-timeframe analysis to confirm signals across different time horizons.

Create a comprehensive Binance API integration with secure credential management. Build a settings panel where users can safely input their Binance API keys and secrets with proper encryption. Implement all necessary API endpoints for real trading including order management, balance checking, and portfolio tracking. Ensure robust error handling for API failures and network issues.

Add multi-language support with complete Arabic and English interfaces. Implement RTL (Right-to-Left) layout support for Arabic, translate all user interface elements, and ensure proper date/number formatting for both languages. Include language switching without page reload.

Develop advanced money management features: Implement Kelly Criterion for optimal position sizing, create a pyramiding system for adding to winning positions, add partial profit taking at multiple targets, and implement trailing stops that automatically adjust based on volatility.

Enhance the market analysis capabilities with sentiment analysis integration, news impact assessment, and social media trend monitoring. Add sector rotation analysis to identify emerging opportunities and implement pair trading capabilities for market-neutral strategies.

Create comprehensive backtesting and optimization tools. Allow users to test strategies against historical data, optimize parameters using genetic algorithms, and compare multiple strategies side-by-side. Implement walk-forward analysis to ensure strategy robustness.

Build sophisticated alert and notification systems: Price level alerts, strategy condition alerts, risk threshold warnings, and performance milestone notifications. Support multiple notification channels including in-app, email, and mobile push notifications.

Finally, implement a continuous learning system where the bot analyzes its own performance, identifies patterns in winning and losing trades, and automatically adjusts parameters to improve future performance. Add a 'conservative mode' that prioritizes capital preservation and an 'aggressive mode' for maximum returns with understood higher risk.

Ensure all enhancements maintain the bot's stability, include proper error handling, and provide detailed logging for troubleshooting and performance analysis. The ultimate goal is creating a truly intelligent trading assistant that can adapt to any market condition while protecting capital and generating consistent profits.
